# failover_mechanism.rb
# This Ruby script demonstrates a basic failover mechanism using Ruby on Rails framework.

    raise 'Primary service failed' if rand(10) < 3

end

# Define a class to represent the backup service
class BackupService
  def call
    puts 'Backup service succeeded'
  end

# Define a class that handles the failover mechanism
