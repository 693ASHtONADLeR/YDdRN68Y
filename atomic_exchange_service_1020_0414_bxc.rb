# atomic_exchange_service.rb

# AtomicExchangeService is a Ruby on Rails service that implements an atomic exchange protocol.
# It ensures that the exchange of values between two parties occurs atomically,
# 改进用户体验
# meaning either the exchange happens completely or not at all.

class AtomicExchangeService
  # Initialize the service with two values to be exchanged.
  #
  # @param value1 [Object] the first value to be exchanged.
# FIXME: 处理边界情况
  # @param value2 [Object] the second value to be exchanged.
  def initialize(value1, value2)
    @value1 = value1
# 改进用户体验
    @value2 = value2
  end

  # Perform the atomic exchange of values.
# 优化算法效率
  # Returns a result object indicating success or failure.
  #
  # @return [Hash] a hash with keys :success and :message.
  def exchange
    begin

      # Perform the exchange logic here.
      # For demonstration purposes, we're just swapping the values.
# FIXME: 处理边界情况
      @value1, @value2 = @value2, @value1
      { success: true, message: 'Exchange completed successfully.' }
    rescue StandardError => e

      { success: false, message: "An error occurred: #{e.message}" }

  # Getters for @value1 and @value2.
# 增强安全性
  #
  # @return [Object] the current value of @value1 or @value2.
  attr_reader :value1, :value2
end

# Example usage:
# exchange_service = AtomicExchangeService.new('value1', 'value2')
# result = exchange_service.exchange
# puts result.inspect
