# smart_contract_development.rb
# This is a Ruby on Rails program that demonstrates basic smart contract development.

# We'll use a simple model to simulate a basic smart contract for a simple agreement.
# This example will include error handling, comments, and best practices for Ruby development.

class SmartContract
  # Initialize the contract with the parties involved
  def initialize(party_a, party_b)
    @party_a = party_a
    @party_b = party_b
  end

  # Execute the contract agreement
  def execute
    # Check if both parties are present
    unless @party_a && @party_b
      raise ArgumentError, "Both parties must be present to execute the contract."
    end

    # Simulate the contract terms
    # In a real smart contract, this would involve more complex logic and blockchain interaction
    if agree_terms
      "Contract executed successfully between #{@party_a} and #{@party_b}."
    else
      raise StandardError, "Contract execution failed due to disagreement on terms."
    end
  end

  private

  # Simulate the agreement on terms (for demonstration purposes, always returns true)
  def agree_terms
    # In a real-world scenario, this would involve more complex logic to determine if terms are agreed upon
    true
  end
end

# Example usage of the SmartContract class
begin
  contract = SmartContract.new("Party A", "Party B")
  result = contract.execute
  puts result
rescue ArgumentError => e
  puts "Error: #{e.message}"
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "Error: #{e.message}"
