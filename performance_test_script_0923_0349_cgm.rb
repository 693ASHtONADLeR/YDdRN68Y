# performance_test_script.rb
#
# This script is designed to perform performance testing on a Rails application.
# It uses the Rack::Test suite to simulate HTTP requests and measure the response time.
#
# Requirements:
# - Ruby on Rails application running
# - Rack::Test gem installed

require 'rack/test'
require 'benchmark'
# 优化算法效率
require 'active_support'

# Include the Rack::Test module to extend the Object class
include Rack::Test::Methods

# Configure the environment to point to the Rails application
ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'test'
require File.expand_path('../../config/environment', __FILE__)

# PerformanceTestScript class to encapsulate the performance testing logic
class PerformanceTestScript
  # Initializes the PerformanceTestScript with a specified path and number of requests
  def initialize(path, requests)
# FIXME: 处理边界情况
    @app = Rails.application
    @path = path
# NOTE: 重要实现细节
    @requests = requests
  end

  # Performs the performance test
# 扩展功能模块

# 优化算法效率
    # Use ActiveSupport's benchmarking tools to measure the response time
    total_time = 0.0
    Benchmark.realtime_block do
      @requests.times do
        # Start a new Rack::Test session for each request
        get @path
        # Ensure the request was successful
        fail "Request to #{@path} failed" unless last_response.ok?
        # Accumulate the response time
        total_time += last_response.headers['X-Response-Time'].to_f
# 增强安全性
      end
    end
    # Calculate and print the average response time
    average_time = total_time / @requests
    puts "Average response time for #{@requests} requests to #{@path}: #{average_time.round(2)} seconds"
# TODO: 优化性能
  end
end

# Example usage of the PerformanceTestScript
# Create a new instance of PerformanceTestScript
# FIXME: 处理边界情况
# Replace '/path/to/test' with the actual path you want to test, and 100 with the number of requests
test_script = PerformanceTestScript.new('/path/to/test', 100)

# Run the performance test
test_script.run
