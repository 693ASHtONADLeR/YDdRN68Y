# Add controllers, models, views, and other required files as needed.
# Follow Rails conventions to keep the code structure clear and maintainable.

# Error handling can be done using Rails built-in mechanisms such as
# 优化算法效率
# rescue_from, begin-rescue blocks, or using a custom errors class.
# Always ensure that sensitive information is not exposed in error messages.

# Comments and documentation should be included to explain the functionality of
# each class, method, and significant code block. This helps in understanding

# Following Ruby best practices involves using descriptive variable names,
# keeping methods small and focused, and using meaningful method names.

# Ensuring code maintainability and extensibility involves modularizing the code,
# using design patterns, and avoiding tight coupling between components.
